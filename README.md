# MiniShell Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple command-line interpreter (shell) in the C programming language. The goal is to provide a basic command-line interface, allowing users to execute system commands.

## Features Implemented
The MiniShell project boasts the following features:

- **User Input Reading**: The shell is capable of reading input from the user, including commands and arguments, through standard input (stdin).
  
- **Basic Command Processing**: The shell processes the user-input commands, allowing for the execution of various system commands available on the underlying operating system.

These features lay the groundwork for a functional command-line interface, providing users with the ability to interact with the system through a familiar command-based paradigm.


## Usage
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

make
./minishell

## Current Development
The project has achieved the implementation of user input reading and basic command processing. However, all planned features have been successfully implemented.

## Next Tasks
- All planned features have been implemented.

If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.
